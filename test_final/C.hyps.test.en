Language, literature, performing art, shape of art, architecture, craft, cinema and broadcasting are all part of European cultural diversity.
The European Union has two objectives: Preserving and supporting the diversity and making it available to others.
The cultural industries in the EU – cinema and audio-visual industries, publishing, music industry and craft – are all essential sources of revenue and job vacancies, employing some seven million people.
The Union has economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for European industry to compete internationally.
The EU has therefore initiated programmes to support certain cultural industries which encourage them to exploit the opportunities offered by the single market and digital technologies.
The EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and facilitating cooperation with its internal and external partners.
The Union also involves a cultural dimension in many of its other policies, such as education (including language learning), research, support for new technologies and the information society and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund supported the Italian Arturo Toscanin Foundation, which has, since the mid-1990s, organised courses for the unemployed musicians.
The specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness of cultural objects and their preservation at European level; to promote transnational mobility of workers in the cultural sector; to encourage transnational circulation of works and cultural and artistic works; encouraging intercultural dialogue.
& quot; Media & quot; programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive have worked since the mid-1990s.
Each year, one and two cities will be selected as the European Capital of Culture and will also give them the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is a cornerstone of culture and democracy in the European Union.
Language not only opens the door to other cultures, but also gives us a practical opportunity to become part of cultural contacts when travelling or working in other countries.
An estimated 40 million people in the EU speak in the English language, which are not the country's country of origin.
The objective of the common agricultural policy is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to supply consumers with high-quality food, and to preserve our ground.
Over the last wave of reforms is already twenty years ago.
Our main information and entertainment source is television.
Each of us, on average, is on average three hours a day for news, sports transfers, films and other shows.
Each national government has its own audiovisual policy, while the Union establishes rules and guidelines for common interests, such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect their cultural diversity and promote local products, the EU has requested a so-called cultural derogation in the World Trade Organisation, which could be achieved.
The pace of technological innovation has led to the emergence of broadcasting and telecommunications.
Open borders and affordable transport have given Europeans unprecedented freedom of movement.
Goods are transported quickly and efficiently to consumers, who are often in different countries.
The European Union has contributed to the competition of the internal market and removing physical and technical barriers to the free movement.
However, the current transport patterns and the growth rate are not sustainable.
The capacity of fast, efficient and cheap transport of people and goods is a guiding principle for the EU's dynamic economy and a coherent society.
Removing barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long distance transport of goods and passengers.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is reasonable to have a single transport infrastructure in the common European market.
Over the past ten years, the EU has opened up public transport markets throughout the Union, in particular the road and air transport sector and the less rail transport sector.
As a result, lorries can also take goods other than domestic, so that they do not turn back empty in international journeys.
Road transport is now transported by 44% of all goods in the EU, with 39% of short sea shipping routes, 10% by rail and 34% by inland waterways.
The transition between freight and passenger transport to less polluting transport modes is a key factor for any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European nations, committed to working together for peace and prosperity.
The EU is not a country that should replace existing countries as well as an organisation of international cooperation.
Europe's historic beginnings go back to the Second World War.
The idea was born because the Europeans decided to prevent the repetition of such killing and destruction.
Six countries have cooperated in the early years, mainly in the area of trade and economy.
There are now 27 countries and 490 million people in the EU, and it deals with many different issues that are directly relevant to our daily lives.
Europe is a continent with many different traditions and languages, but also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the world of the 21st century, in which countries are increasingly dependent on one another, every European citizen needs to cooperate with other countries in the spirit of curiosity, openness and solidarity.
You can travel through most of the EU without your passport and without stopping you.
The EU's 10 pillars since the Schuman Declaration and the six Member States in the 1950s and 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950 the Schuman Declaration was proposed to establish the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was the same as the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1951.
The customs duties between six countries were fully repealed on 1 July 1968 and common policies, in particular trade and agricultural policy, were introduced in the 1960s.
In June 1979 a decisive step forward for the European Community was taken as the first direct and general elections of the European Parliament were held.
The European political form changed considerably in 1989 by the Berlin Wall.
In March 2000, the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy to modernise the European economy and to enable it to compete on the world market with other important actors such as the US and the new industrialised countries.
A traveler has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier.
You can overcome many borders in the EU without control and the benefits of the euro will be made easier.
The Green Card is not mandatory for travel within the EU, but it is an internationally accepted insurance certificate and facilitates the fulfilment of the requirements arising from accidents.
The creation of a single European market in air transport has meant lower fares and a wider range of airlines and services for passengers.
There are 210 000 km of rail in the EU providing various international passenger services.
Several countries have high-speed trains with a speed of up to 300 km / h and this year the network will be extended to new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
In the Baltic Sea, Latvia is a low country with large forests, which will be stowed for construction and paper.
It also produces consumer and textile goods and workplaces.
The population of the population is 59% of Latvian and 29% of the Russians, and over a third of the population live in the capital of Riga.
It is the biggest city in the Baltic, with 730 000 inhabitants.
The Latvian National Parliament will be elected on direct universal suffrage every four years.
The President shall elect Parliament and every four years.
The characteristic cracks of the Latvian kitchen are bacon pies and a cold refreshing furnace mill.
The website is divided into three parts to facilitate access to legislation, activity reports, brochures, audiovisual material, national documents, archives, etc.
It lists the sites for all documents or activities of the institutions.

The aim of the seminar is to give participants the opportunity to exchange the ideas, methods and applications of calculation systems in order to address the challenges faced by all traineeships, to assess the level of the field and to identify possible areas for further joint research.
There are many listeners, including translators, business leaders, scientists and linguistic experts.
Once again, the latest progress and (translation) software have been discussed at the conference.
The conference meets the needs of the following parties: Industry, public administration, authorities, freelance and developers.
Changing the Internet-based exchange of information in recent times has led to new progress in the area of multilingual natural language processing.
Recently, there has been an interest in the automatic identification of the same expressions in different languages.
New exciting guides have arisen, such as the use of online and comparable language corps for this, and attention has been given to new language phenomena such as the notion and the names of several names.
The seminar brings together scientists responsible for the management of multilingual language tools – their acquisition, management, adjustment and re-use.
The seminar provides an assessment of multilingual leakages, which are intended for a variety of applications: The interpreters of the translation project, up to a large number of adaptable divisions and databases.
An international test chemical reactor, an important test facility intended to demonstrate that fusion power generation is scientifically and technically feasible.
Research and innovation will help create jobs, improve welfare and quality of life.
After successful attempts in recent years, fusion energy research and development have reached a point where effective progress can be expected in the direction of nuclear fusion in the direction of sustainable energy production.
The European Research Commissioner Janez Potočnik said.
If our businesses must play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge now and governments must take appropriate measures to assist them.
The EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
Fusion offers the opportunity to produce almost unlimited amounts of clean energy over a long period of time.
The low level of private R & amp; D spending in Europe compared with the US is mainly due to differences in the industrial fabric and the smaller European technology industry.
As far as the scientific level is concerned, although the EU is the world's largest creator of scientific knowledge, the impact of European research is lower than its own.
Europe is lagging behind in all scientific disciplines in terms of the impact of citates and the number of green works quoted.
EU universities are also highly under-represented at the top of a tension line based on bibliometric characteristics of the world's largest universities.
In addition, the communication technology (patented inventions) and the science base in the EU are much weaker than in the US.
It is difficult for Europe to achieve a breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, a new discovery of research and development began when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch a Europe-wide public and private R & amp; D partnership.
In order to ensure our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach in certain promising areas.
This is an area where national, European and industrial funding of research is much less added, creating favourable assumptions for research and development funding for the private sector.
Invisible computers (embedded computers) today drive all machines from cars, aircraft and phones, from energy networks and plants to washing machines and televisions.
There is a forecast of more than 16 billion manusages by 2010 and more than 40 billion devices worldwide by 2020.
By 2010 these invisible chips account for 30-40% of the value of new products for consumers (41%), telecommunications (37%), automotive (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The Innovative Medicines Initiative will support the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to enable faster deployment of better and safer medicines.
At present, the European Commission presents its ideas on the European Research Area, which represents the potential of most European knowledge.
The Commission aims at mobilising this potential, enabling people, infrastructures, organisations, funding sources, knowledge exchange, and global cooperation to operate efficiently.
More effective creation and use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and societal objectives listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Our future depends on Europe becoming a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is the basis for which this knowledge society must be built.
It is difficult for businesses to create partnerships with universities, particularly universities located in other countries.
Researchers still meet barriers to career development or other EU research work.
Research and regional funding are largely uncoordinated and therefore ineffective.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
The document has been accompanied by guidelines which help the research institutions to improve their links with industry, which highlight good practices in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property.
Sufficient competent scientists who are very mobile between institutions, academia, sectors and countries are one of the main pillars.
The objective of the Directive is to achieve a high level of good quality of all rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater in the European Union by 2015.
Sustainable water management is vital to biodiversity, citizens' well-being and the competitiveness of European industries.
Participating partners will benefit from greater visibility, greater capacity in research and development, better financial incentives and a reduction in the costs incurred.
Businesses will be directly involved in research and education, thereby helping to support entrepreneurial mindsets among university graduates and researchers.
The European Commission is currently taking a position on how best to update the European universities.
European universities have enormous potential, most of which remains unspent because of the rigidity and various obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talent and energy resources requires an immediate, comprehensive and coordinated change: From system regulation and management to university management methods.
Although universities train and teach millions of people every year, there are still many obstacles in European higher education systems, many of which are decades old.
Universities are the driving force for knowledge creation.
Universities need to adapt to global, knowledge-based economy requirements as they have to adapt to other sectors of society and economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, research and innovation, which is best suited to its role in its region or country.
The aim is to create a framework in which overschools can become stronger players in a global knowledge society and economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practice and through its education, research and innovation funding programmes.
The European Commission has identified nine areas where changes should be made so that European universities can contribute to a genuine knowledge economy.
One of the proposals is to enable students to benefit from national loans and grants throughout the EU where they decide to study or make science.
We need to change national curricula and support schemes so that the best students can participate in higher education and continue their scientific career, regardless of their background.
We need to change the funding systems of universities to focus more on the outcome and allow universities more responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability, particularly in research.
We must allow universities more autonomy and responsibility to respond quickly to changes.
This may include a review of curricula for their adaptation to new developments, the creation of closer relations between research areas and the focus on general research (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology) rather than specific research areas.
It could also involve increased autonomy at the level of the individual institutions in the selection of study and research staff.
In all EU Member States the safety belt should now be confirmed in all vehicles, including tourist buses and microbus.
Observe that in Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom, you are driving on the left side and bear in mind that in some countries, such as Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Portugal, you generally have to give a better approach to approaching vehicles.
The use of a mobile phone during the management of the vehicle will significantly increase the risk of life threatening accidents and is prohibited directly or indirectly in all EU Member States.
Although most EU Member States have a maximum authorised alcoholic strength of 0,5 mg / ml, it amounts to 0,2 mg / ml to 0,8 mg / ml (0.9 mg / ml in Cyprus) and in some countries there should be no alcohol at all times during driving.
When travelling within the EU, the travel insurance policy automatically provides the insurance protection required by the minimum law (motor insurance).
The speed limit is generally 110, 120 or 130 km / h on motorways and 50 or 60 km / h in the locations.
In the case of air passengers, you have certain rights in the event of air and reservation information, baggage damage, delays and missed flights, booming, accident or travel problems.
These rights apply both to national and international routes and orders flights from one EU airport or from an outside EU airport to an EU air carrier.
New rules on liquids have been introduced which may be carried out by passengers at the airport inspection posts.
Liquids (including creams, gels, toothpaste, sprayers, perfumes) must be supplied with a maximum volume of 100 ml.
Passengers are allowed to carry out liquids purchased from the outlet, such as beverages or perfumes.
Reflecting the will of European citizens and countries to build a common future, this constitution establishes the European Union, which is the responsibility of the Member States to achieve its common objectives.
The Union shall coordinate the policies of the Member States for those objectives and shall exercise the competences assigned to it.
The Union is founded on values such as respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.
The peoples of Europe have decided to share the rest of the European Union through an increasingly closer union.
The Union recognises its mental and moral heritage and is founded on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; the Union is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
The Union shall support the preservation and development of these common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe, as well as the national identity of the Member States and the organisation of national, regional and local authorities; the Union shall endeavour to promote balanced and sustainable development and to ensure the free movement of persons, services, goods and capital and freedom of establishment.
In view of the change of society, social progress and scientific and technical progress, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights by making them clearer in the Charter.
Their rights are accompanied by responsibilities and obligations towards other people, human society and future generations.
The right to marry and the right to a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights.
Everyone has the right to peaceful assembly and to set up associations at all levels, in particular in the fields of politics, trade unions and civil society; this includes the right of everyone to establish and step up the trade unions to defend their interests.
The Union shall be a common institutional framework ensuring the continuity and continuity of the activities undertaken to achieve its objectives, while respecting and developing the acquis communautaire.
The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors shall exercise their powers in accordance with their respective conditions and objectives laid down in the Treaties establishing the European Communities and those amending and supplementing the Treaties and other provisions of this Agreement.
The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, which are common to all Member States.
The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, amend or withdraw measures adopted under paragraph 3 if the circumstances which led to their introduction change.
Member States shall cooperate to deepen and develop their mutual political solidarity.
The European Council shall define the principles and general guidelines of the common foreign and security policy, including on matters relating to defence implications.
The European Council shall decide on a common strategy for the Union in those areas where Member States have important common interests.
The Council shall review the principles and objectives of that measure and make the necessary decisions.
The Council may request the Commission to submit appropriate proposals relating to the common foreign and security policy to ensure the implementation of the Joint Action.
Where necessary, Member States may take the necessary urgent measures, taking account of the general objectives of the Joint Action.
The Union policies in this Article shall not affect the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall take into account the obligations of the Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), in accordance with the common security and defence policy established under the Treaty.
In international organisations and at international conferences, which are not all the Member States, the participating Member States shall support the common positions.
The European Parliament may question questions or make recommendations to the Council.
It shall hold an annual debate on the progress made in implementing the common foreign and security policy.
Each Member State or the Commission may refer to the Council questions relating to the common foreign and security policy and to propose to the Council.
In cases of urgency, the Presidency shall convene an extraordinary Council meeting on its own initiative or at the request of the Commission or of a Member State for a shorter period of forty-eight hours.
Where a member of the Council declares that he intends, for reasons relating to the policy of the Member State and for the reasons stated, to be adopted by a qualified majority, the matter shall not be put to the vote.
The European Union established by this Treaty is the successor to the European Union and the European Community established by the Treaty on European Union.
The Government of each Member State, the European Parliament or the Commission may submit proposals to the Council for the amendment of this Agreement.
If, two years after the signature of the Agreement amending this Agreement, four fifths of the Member States have ratified it, but one or more Member States have difficulties in ratification, the matter shall be discussed by the European Council.
The Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty) was signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958.
The objective of the Euratom Treaty was to coordinate research programmes for the peaceful use of nuclear energy already started or planned in the Member States.
This agreement is now part of the EC Treaty.
The Treaties contain the conditions imposed on the accession of the new States to the European Union and the necessary adjustments to the Treaties.
The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC Treaty) is the oldest of the three European Community Treaties and was signed in Paris on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002.
The objective of the Agreement was to establish a common coal and steel market and the same scheme was scheduled to be extended to other sectors of the economy.
The coal and steel sector is now subject to the EC Treaty.
Such agreements shall always be concluded between the entities of international law (Member States or organisations) with a view to starting international cooperation.
International agreements are another source of EU legislation that allows the European Union to develop economic, social and political relations with the rest of the world.
Agreements concluded under the first pillar of the European Union are binding on the Union and the Member States; the agreements concluded within the Union under the second and third pillars are binding on the institutions, but not always the Member States.
The association agreements cover close economic cooperation with a comprehensive Community financial contribution to the partner.
Cooperation agreements are not as comprehensive as the association agreements, since only close economic cooperation is concerned.
Trade agreements shall be the customs and trade policy instruments concluded with non-EU countries or with the non-EU group or within the framework of the international trade organisations.
Agreements between Member States have been covered by binding legislation between Member States either for the purpose of resolving issues which are closely connected with Community action, but which have not been given the powers conferred on the Community institutions or to extend the borders of national provisions in order to establish a single legal instrument at Community level (for example, the Community patent agreement).
Secondary legislation is the third largest source of Community legislation after the Treaties and international treaties.
Secondary legislation includes binding acts (regulations, directives and decisions) as set out in the EC Treaty and non-binding acts (resolutions, opinions) with a number of other acts such as internal rules for institutions and Community action programmes.
Legislation relating to the second and third pillar, which does not, in fact, fall within the scope of secondary legislation, since they continue to be governed by intergovernmental relations, is covered by a fine document.
A Regulation adopted jointly by the Council and the European Parliament or adopted only by the Commission is the main measure of which all parts are binding.
Unlike directives aimed at Member States and decisions targeting individual recipients, regulations are aimed at everyone.
The regulation is directly applicable, which means that it will create a law which will enter into force in all Member States without delay, as is the case with national law, without the national authorities having to do something further.
Consolidation consists of a single text, which is not formally authentic.

There is much talk about inflation in this game, and it is my job to find out if there are inflation.
This makes consumers more natural, because they compete on several levels, not only at tactical level, but also for logistics and resources.
As a real economic person, I had to spend months looking for the data to test the economic theory, but when I was wrong, I was not sure if it was false or wrong.
When we had opened the area where more cydriin was found (in the game of a mineral), we saw that the price fell.
& quot; These patents are linked to technologies which improve the operation and efficiency of radio communication equipment, but also allow lower production costs, small size products and battery longer working, & quot; said Nokia.
These technologies are important for the success of Nokia because they give this product a competitive advantage over other producers.
Both industries and analysts assume that the licence agreement between them has a huge impact on the future of 3G technologies.
This game will introduce a culture of resistance to children: That the occupation must be resisted and that land and people must be watched.
With this game, the child will have a vision of any more than one more prominent battle and that the enemy is impossible.
